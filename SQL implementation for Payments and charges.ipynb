# Payment and charges: a SQL implementation
In Data/payments.csv we have a stream of payment records<br>
In Data/charges.csv we have a stream of charges records<br>

The payments records, that are identified only by the payments date and don't have any reference to the charge record, must be allocated in the order they arrive to the charge records ordered by their bill dates

The final SQL query result is parked in <sql_payment_allocation> pandas dataframe.

Prerequirements:
- Pandas: only to load csv in a table in memory
- SQLite: to have a SQL engine capable to manage my queries without any configuration ( :-) in memory)
